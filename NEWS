CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.2
-------------------------

  o Updated functions to build Gene Ontology genesets for human, mouse, rat, and fly.

    o Enforce minimum geneset size of 10.

    o Include code for roxygen2 documentation blocks to be placed in R/data.R.

  o Updated documentation to include package version numbers and build dates.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.1
-------------------------

  o Added locus definitions for hg38, rn5, rn6, and dm6.

  o All genomes have the following locus definitions:

    o nearest_tss, nearest_gene, exon, intron, 1kb, 5kb, 10kb, 1kb_outside_upstream,
      5kb_outside_upstream, 10kb_outside_upstream, 1kb_outside, 5kb_outside, and
      10kb_outside.

  o Internal changes to LocusDefinition class

    o Remove chrom2iranges representation in favor of granges

    o mcols for granges representation are 'gene_id' (formerly names) and 'symbol'

    o Including gene symbols in the LocusDefinition allows removal of genes.*.RData

  o Internal changes to tss.*.RData objects

    o These are now GRanges instead of a list with different representations

  o Code to use to construct LocusDefinition and tss RData objects are in data-raw/
    which is viewable in the package source.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4
------------------------

  o Support for D. melanogaster genome (dm3)

  o All genomes (dm3, hg19, mm9, mm10, and rn4) have the following locus definitions
    o 1kb, 5kb, 10kb, >10kb, introns, exons, nearest_gene, and nearest_tss

  o New example histone data set, peaks_H3K4me3_GM12878, based on hg19.

  o New gene sets from Reactome for human, mouse, and rat.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0
----------------------

PKG FEATURES

  o Supporting package containing data for use with the chipenrich package.

  o Contains genesets for many databases including Biocarta, KEGG, OMIM, etc.

  o Contains gene locus definitions (for assigning ChIP-seq peaks to genes)

  o Contains mappability estimates for each gene locus definition

  o Example ChIP-seq peak datasets

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Locus definitions for mm10

BUG FIXES

  o Mouse mappability gene IDs were incorrect for some locus definitions and
    would cause a crash if used

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Added support for rat (locus definitions, gene sets from GO and ConceptGen/LRpath)

BUG FIXES

  o Fixed nearest gene mappabilities for human and mouse

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.1
------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Changed TSSs to come from knownGenes instead of refFlat

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4
----------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Changed format of TSS object to include strand information
  o Updated cytoband to use Bioconductor (org.Mm.eg.db) for mouse
